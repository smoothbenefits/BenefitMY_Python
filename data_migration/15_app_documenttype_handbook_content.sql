1.1  History, Goals & Culture 
1.2  Purpose of this Handbook 
This handbook has been prepared to inform new employees of the policies and procedures of this company and to establish the company’s expectations. It is not all- inclusive or intended to provide strict interpretations of our policies; rather, it offers an overview of the work environment. This handbook is not a contract, expressed or implied, guarantying employment for any length of time and is not intended to induce an employee to accept employment with the company. 
The company reserves the right to unilaterally revise, suspend, revoke, terminate or change any of its policies, in whole or in part, whether described within this handbook or elsewhere, in its sole discretion. If any discrepancy between this handbook and current company policy arises, conform to current company policy. Every effort will be made to keep you informed of the company’s policies, however we cannot guarantee that notice of revisions will be provided. Feel free to ask questions about any of the information within this handbook. 
This handbook supersedes and replaces any and all personnel policies and manuals previously distributed, made available or applicable to employees. 
1.3 At-Will Employment 
Employment at this company is at-will. An at-will employment relationship can be terminated at any time, with or without reason or notice by either the employer or the employee. This at-will employment relationship exists regardless of any statements by office personnel to the contrary. Only {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}} is authorized to modify the at-will nature of the employment relationship, and the modification must be in writing. 

Section 2 – Workplace Commitments 
2.1 Equal Opportunity Employment 
This company is an equal opportunity employer and does not unlawfully discriminate against employees or applicants for employment on the basis of an individual’s race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law. This policy applies to all terms, conditions and privileges of employment, including recruitment, hiring, placement, compensation, promotion, discipline and termination. 
Whenever possible, the company makes reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities to the extent required by law. Employees who would like to request a reasonable accommodation should contact {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. 
2.2 Non-Harassment Policy / Non-Discrimination Policy 
This company prohibits discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law. Each individual has the right to work in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and is free from discriminatory practices, including without limitation harassment. Consistent with its workplace policy of equal employment opportunity, the company prohibits and will not tolerate harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law.

Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets; slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation in the workplace of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group based on their protected characteristic.

Any company employee who feels that he or she has been harassed or discriminated against, or has witnessed or become aware of discrimination or harassment in violation of these policies, should bring the matter to the immediate attention of his or her supervisor or [enter name of alternative person to whom employees can report]. The company will promptly investigate all allegations of discrimination and harassment, and take action as appropriate based on the outcome of the investigation. An investigation and its results will be treated as confidential to the extent feasible, and the company will take appropriate action based on the outcome of the investigation. 
No employee will be retaliated against for making a complaint in good faith regarding a violation of these policies, or for participating in good faith in an investigation pursuant to these policies. If an employee feels he/she has been retaliated against, the employee should file a complaint using the procedures set forth above. 
2.3 Drug-Free / Alcohol-Free Environment 
Employees are prohibited from unlawfully consuming, distributing, possessing, selling, or using controlled substances while on duty. In addition, employees may not be under the influence of any controlled substance, such as drugs or alcohol, while at work, on company premises or engaged in company business. Prescription drugs or over-the- counter medications, taken as prescribed, are an exception to this policy. 
Anyone violating this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 

2.4 Open Door Policy 
The company has an open door policy and takes employee concerns and problems seriously. The company values each employee and strives to provide a positive work experience. Employees are encouraged to bring any workplace concerns or problems they might have or know about to their supervisor or some other member of management. 
 
Section 3 – Company Policies and Procedures 
3.1 Professional Conduct 
This company expects its employees to adhere to a standard of professional conduct and integrity. This ensures that the work environment is safe, comfortable and productive. Employees should be respectful, courteous, and mindful of others’ feelings and needs. General cooperation between coworkers and supervisors is expected. Individuals who act in an unprofessional manner may be subject to disciplinary action. 
3.2 Dress Code 
An employee’s personal appearance and hygiene is a reflection on the company’s character. Employees are expected to dress appropriately for their individual work responsibilities and position. 
3.3 Payday 
Paychecks are distributed every month. If the pay date lands on a holiday, paychecks will be distributed on the closest business day before the holiday. 
Paychecks include salary or wages earned less any mandatory or elected deductions. Mandatory deductions include federal or state withholding tax, and other withholdings. Elected deductions are deductions authorized by the employee, and may include, for example, contributions to benefit plans. Employees may contact [enter authorized person’s name] to obtain the necessary authorization forms for requesting additional deductions from their paychecks. 
Notify a supervisor if the paycheck appears to be inaccurate or if it has been misplaced. The company reserves the right to charge a replacement fee for any lost paychecks. Advances on paychecks are not permitted. Information regarding final paychecks can be found under the termination section of this handbook. 
Any change in name, address, telephone number, marital status or number of exemptions claimed by an employee must be reported to {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}  immediately. 

3.4 Company Property 
Company property, such as equipment, vehicles, telephones, computers, and software, is not for private use. These devices are to be used strictly for company business, and are not permitted off grounds unless authorized. Company property must be used in the manner for which it was intended. Upon termination, employees are required to surrender any company property they possess. 
Company computers, internet and emails are a privileged resource, and must be used only to complete essential job-related functions. Employees are not permitted to download any “pirated” software, files or programs and must receive permission from a supervisor before installing any new software on a company computer. Files or programs stored on company computers may not be copied for personal use. 
Phones are provided for business use. The company requests that employees not receive personal calls while on duty. If urgent, please keep personal calls to a minimum and conversations brief. Personal long distance calls are not permitted. 
Employees are reminded that they should have no expectation of privacy in their use of company computers or other electronic equipment. 
Violations of these policies could result in disciplinary action. 
 
3.5 Privacy 
Employees and employers share a relationship based on trust and mutual respect. However, the company retains the right to access all company property including computers, desks, file cabinets, storage facilities, and files and folders, electronic or otherwise, at any time. Employees should not entertain any expectations of privacy when on company grounds or while using company property. 
All documents, files, voice-mails and electronic information, including e-mails and other communications, created, received or maintained on or through company property are the property of the company, not the employee. Therefore employees should have no expectation of privacy over those files or documents. 
3.6 Personnel Files 
The company maintains a personnel file on each employee. These files are kept confidential to the extent possible. Employees may review their personnel file upon request. 
It is important that personnel files accurately reflect each employee’s personal information. Employees are expected to inform the company of any change in name, address, home phone number, home address, marital status, number of dependents or emergency contact information. 
 
Section 4 - Employment Classification 
This company assigns positions, determines wages and compensates employees for overtime in accordance with state and local laws and the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
4.1 ExemptEmployees 
Exempt employees are those that are excluded from the overtime pay requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Exempt employees are paid a salary and are expected to work beyond their normal work hours whenever necessary to accomplish the work of the company. Exempt employees are not eligible to receive overtime compensation. Employees should consult with an administrator if they have questions regarding their classification as an exempt employee. 
4.2 Non-Exempt Employees 
Non-exempt employees are those eligible for overtime pay of 1.5 times the regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 per work week. All overtime must be approved in advance. Employees should consult with an administrator if they have questions regarding their classification as a non-exempt employee. 
 
4.3 Part Time, Full Time or Temporary Status 
Part-time or full-time status depends on the number of hours per week an employee works. Regular employees who work fewer than 40 hours receive part-time classification. Part-time employees are not eligible for employee benefits as described in this handbook. Regular employees who work at least 40 hours receive full-time classification. 
From time to time the company may hire employees for specific projects or periods of time. Temporary employees may work either part-time or full-time, but generally are scheduled to terminate by a certain date. Temporary employees who remain on duty past the scheduled termination remain classified as temporary. Only {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}} may change an employee’s temporary status. Temporary employees are not eligible for employment benefits. 

Section 5 – Attendance Policies 
5.1 GeneralAttendance 
The company maintains normal working hours of 8-5. Hours may vary depending on work location and job responsibilities. Supervisors will provide employees with their work schedule. Should an employee have any questions regarding his/her work schedule, the employee should contact the supervisor. 
The company does not tolerate absenteeism without excuse. Employees who will be late to or absent from work should notify a supervisor in advance, or as soon as practicable in the event of an emergency. Chronic absenteeism may result in disciplinary action. 
Employees who need to leave early, for illness or otherwise, should inform a supervisor before departure. Unauthorized departures may result in disciplinary action. 
5.2 Tardiness 
Employees are expected to arrive on time and ready for work. An employee who arrives 60 minutes after their scheduled arrival time is considered tardy. The company recognizes that situations arise which hinder punctuality; regardless, excessive tardiness is prohibited, and may be subject to disciplinary action. 
5.3 Breaks 
When working conditions permit, and pending a supervisor’s approval, employees are entitled to 15 minute breaks for every two hours worked. 
Meal periods are for 60 minutes, and must be approved by a supervisor. 

Section 6 – Leave Policies 
6.1 Vacations 
The company provides, as a benefit, paid vacations for its eligible employees. Forward requests for time off in advance to a supervisor, who may approve or deny the request based on company resources. The company is flexible in approving time off when doing so would not interfere with company operations. Vacation days are granted only on a full day or half-day basis. 
A regular employee is eligible to receive paid time off after [enter number] months of full-time service. Accrued time off may be taken after [enter eligibility dates]. Employees must earn and accrue vacation benefits before they may be used. Employees should consult {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}} regarding the amount of vacation leave they accrue each pay period. 
Any remaining accrued time off may not be accumulated or carried forward into the next year. Vacation benefits do not accrue during any period of extended leave of absence. 
6.2 Sick Leave 
Situations may arise where an employee needs to take time off to address medical or other health concerns. The company requests that employees provide notification to their supervisor as soon as practicable when taking time off. Sick days are granted on an unpaid basis to regular employees. Employees may consult {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}} regarding the amount of (paid) sick leave provided each year. Sick days may not be carried over into the next year. Abuse of this policy may result in disciplinary action. 
6.3 Family and Medical Leave Act Leave 
The company offers leave consistent with the requirements of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Under the FMLA, an employee may be eligible for an  
unpaid family and medical leave of absence under certain circumstances, if the employee works within a seventy-five (75) mile radius of fifty (50) or more company employees. 
Under the federal FMLA, a person who has worked as an employee of this company for at least 1,250 hours for twelve months is eligible for FMLA leave. Up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave per year is available for the following reasons: 
-  The birth of a child and to care for the newborn child; 
-  Placement of a child into adoptive or foster care with the employee; 
-  Care for a spouse, son, daughter or parent who has a serious health condition; or 
-  Care for the employee’s own serious health condition. 
If the need for leave is foreseeable, employees should notify a supervisor 30 days prior to taking FMLA leave. If the need for FMLA leave arises unexpectedly, employees should notify a supervisor as soon as practicable, giving as much notice to the company as possible. 
Employees may be required to provide: medical certifications supporting the need for leave if the leave is due to a serious health condition of the employee or employee’s family member; periodic recertification of the serious health condition; and periodic reports during the leave regarding the employee’s status and intent to return to work. Employees must return to work immediately after the serious health condition ceases, and employees who have taken leave because of their own serious health condition must submit a fitness-for-duty certification before being allowed to return to work. 
Leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced schedule to care for an illness; yet, may not be taken intermittently for the care of a newborn or newly adopted child. When leave is taken intermittently, the company may transfer the employee to another position with equivalent pay and benefits, which is better suited to periods of absence. 
Subject to certain conditions, the employee or the company may choose to use accrued paid leave (such as sick leave or vacation leave) concurrent with FMLA leave. 
The company will maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on family and medical leave on the same terms as if the employee had continued work. If applicable, arrangements will be made for the employee to pay their share of health insurance premiums while on leave. The company may recover premiums paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from family and medical leave. 

If an employee would like the company to maintain other paid benefits during the period of leave, premiums and charges which are partially or wholly paid by the employee must continue to be paid by the employee during the leave time. 
Family and medical leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commenced. However, an employee on family and medical leave does not continue to accrue benefits (e.g., sick leave or vacation leave) during the period of family and medical leave. Questions regarding particular benefits should be directed to {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. 
Upon returning from FMLA leave, an employee will be restored to his/her original job or an equivalent job with equivalent benefits, pay, seniority, and other employment terms and conditions as provided by the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
6.4 Holidays 
The company observes the following holidays: 
-  New Year’s Day 
-  Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 
-  Memorial Day 
-  Independence Day 
-  Labor Day 
-  Thanksgiving 
-  Christmas Day 
and other holidays that are mandated holidays by the state.
Holidays are observed on a [paid/unpaid] basis for all eligible employees. [Full time employees are eligible for paid holiday benefits.] 
6.5 Jury Duty Time Off 
The company understands that occasionally employees are called to serve on a jury. Employees who are selected for jury duty must provide a copy of their jury summons to a supervisor. Time taken for jury duty is granted on an unpaid basis. Employees released from jury duty with 4 hours remaining in the workday, are expected to return to work. 
6.6 Voting Time Off 
Employees are encouraged to participate in elections. The company grants incremental time off to cast a ballot in an election. Voting time off is granted on an unpaid basis. Should extenuating circumstances arise while voting, notify a supervisor as soon as possible. 
6.7 Military Leave 
Employees called to active military duty, military reserve or National Guard service may be eligible to receive time off under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994. To receive time off, employees must provide notice and a copy of their report orders to an immediate supervisor. Military leave is granted on an unpaid basis. Upon return with an honorable discharge, an employee may be entitled to reinstatement and any applicable job benefits they would have received if present, to the extent provided by law. 
 
6.8 Leave of Absence 
Regular full-time employees may request an unpaid leave of absence after the exhaustion of paid leave. A request for a leave of absence must be submitted in writing in advance to the employee''s immediate supervisor. 
Leave of absences that are granted are unpaid, and will not be considered until an employee has exhausted all appropriate accrued leave balances. Continuation of employee benefits during a leave of absence will be addressed on an individual basis, as required by law. 
 
Section 7 – Work Performance 
7.1 Expectations 
The company expects every employee to act in a professional manner. Satisfactory performance of job duties and responsibilities is key to this expectation. Employees should attempt to achieve their job objectives, and act with diligence and consideration at all times. Poor job performance can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
7.2 Reviews
The company may periodically evaluate an employee’s performance. The goal of a performance review is to identify areas where an employee excels and areas that need improvement. The company uses performance reviews as a tool to determine pay increases, promotions and/or terminations. 
All performance reviews are based on merit, achievement and other factors may include but are not limited to: 
-  Quality of work 
-  Attitude 
-  Knowledge of work 
-  Job skills 
-  Attendance and punctuality 
-  Teamwork and cooperation 
-  Compliance with company policy 
-  Past performance reviews 
-  Improvement 
-  Acceptance of responsibility and constructive feedback 
Employees should note that a performance review does not guarantee a pay increase or promotion. Written performance evaluations may be made at any time to advise employees of unacceptable performance. Evaluations or any subsequent change in employment status, position or pay does not alter the employee’s at will-relationship with the company. 
Forward any questions about performance expectation or evaluation to the supervisor conducting the evaluation. 
7.3 Insubordination 
Supervisors and employees should interact with mutual respect and common courtesy. Employees are expected to take instruction from supervisors or other persons of authority. Failure to comply with instructions or unreasonably delaying compliance is considered insubordination. Acts of insubordination are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
If an employee disagrees with a supervisor, the employee should first try to mediate the situation by explaining their position. If possible, a compromise might be met and accusations of insubordination avoided. 

Section 8 – Discipline Policy 
8.1 Grounds for Disciplinary Action 
The company reserves the right to discipline and/or terminate any employee who violates company polices, practices or rules of conduct. Poor performance and misconduct are also grounds for discipline or termination. 
The following actions are unacceptable and considered grounds for disciplinary action. This list is not comprehensive; rather, it is meant merely as an example of the types of conduct that this company does not tolerate. These actions include, but are not limited to:

The company reserves the right to determine the severity and extent of any disciplinary action based on the circumstances of each case. 
8.2 Procedures 
Disciplinary action is any one of a number of options used to correct unacceptable behavior or actions. Discipline may take the form of oral warnings, written warnings, probation, suspension, demotion, discharge, removal or some other disciplinary action, in no particular order. The course of action will be determined by the company at its sole discretion as it deems appropriate.

Section 9 – Health and Safety 
9.1 Workplace Safety 
The company takes every reasonable precaution to ensure that employees have a safe working environment. Safety measures and rules are in place for the protection of all employees. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of each employee to help prevent accidents. To ensure the continuation of a safe workplace, all employees should review and understand all provisions of the company’s workplace safety policy. Employees should use all safety and protective equipment provided to them, and maintain work areas in a safe and orderly manner, free from hazardous conditions. Employees who observe an unsafe practice or condition should report it to a supervisor or [enter alternate name] immediately. Employees are prohibited from making threats against anyone in connection with his/her work or engaging in violent activities while in the employ of the company. Any questions regarding safety and safe practices should be directed to {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. 
In the event of an accident, employees must notify a supervisor immediately. Report every injury, regardless of how minor, to a supervisor immediately. Physical discomfort caused by repetitive tasks must also be reported. For more information about on the job injuries, refer to the worker’s compensation section of this handbook. 
Employees should recognize any potential fire hazards and be aware of fire escape routes and fire drills. Do not block fire exits, tamper with fire extinguishers or otherwise create fire hazards. 
9.2 Workplace Security 
Employees must be alert and aware of any potential dangers to themselves or their coworkers. Take every precaution to ensure that your surroundings are safe and secure. Guard personal belongings and company property. Visitors should be escorted at all times. Report any suspicious activity to a supervisor immediately.  
9.3 Emergency Procedures 
In the event of an emergency, dial 911 immediately. If you hear a fire alarm or other emergency alert system, proceed quickly and calmly to the nearest exit. Once the building has been evacuated, only a supervisor may authorize employees to reenter. 

Section 10 - Employee Benefits 
This handbook contains descriptions of some of our current employee benefits. Many of the company’s benefit plans are described in more formal plan documents available from {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. In the event of any inconsistencies between this handbook or any other oral or written description of benefits and a formal plan document, the formal plan document will govern. 
10.1 Health Insurance 
The company makes group health benefits available to eligible employees and their family members. Eligible employees are full time employees who have worked for 12 months. Part time employees are eligible if they work at least 30 hours per week and have been employed for 12 months. 
Health benefits are paid in part by the company. The remainder of the costs is the employee’s responsibility. Employees can receive details about benefits provided, contribution rates and eligibility from {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. 
10.2 RetirementPlan 
The company participates in a 401(k) plan so that employees may save a portion of their earnings for retirement. Regular employees who have worked at least 40 hours/week for 12 months are eligible to participate. Employees may elect to make regular contributions to the 401(k) plan up to the maximum amount allowed by federal law. 
Contact {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}} for detailed information regarding eligibility, employee contributions, vesting period or employer contributions. More information can also be found in the plan summary description, which is available from {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. If there are any inconsistencies between this handbook and any of the Summary Plan Descriptions, the Summary Plan Descriptions shall govern. The company reserves the right to modify or terminate any or all of its retirement benefits or to change benefit providers at any time with or without notice. 
10.3 Workers’ Compensation 
As required by law, the company provides workers’ compensation benefits for the protection of employees with work-related injuries or illnesses. 
Workers’ compensation insurance provides coverage to employees who receive job- related injuries or illnesses. If an employee is injured or becomes ill as a result of his/her job, it is the employee’s responsibility to immediately notify a supervisor of their injury in order to receive benefits. Report every illness or injury to a supervisor, regardless of how minor it appears. The company will advise the employee of the procedure for submitting a workers’ compensation claim. If necessary, injured employees will be referred to a medical care facility. Employees should retain all paperwork provided to them by the medical facility. Failure to report a work-related illness or injury promptly could result in denial of benefits. An employee’s report should contain as many details as possible, including the date, time, description of the illness or injury, and the names of any witnesses. 
A separate insurance company administers the worker’s compensation insurance. Representatives of this company may contact injured employees regarding their benefits under the plan. Additional information regarding workers’ compensation is available from {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. 
10.4 Disability Coverage 
Disability insurance provides partial paycheck reimbursement for times of serious illness or injury which leads to total disability. Total disability is defined as the inability to perform any job function as a result of the injury or illness. Employees who have worked for 12 months are eligible for disability insurance coverage. To qualify for benefits, the period of total disability must exceed 30 days. 
 
Coverage extends for 30 days of disability. Employees must exhaust any sick leave benefits before being eligible for disability leave coverage. 
Disability benefits are calculated as a percentage of an employees base salary as defined by the state law. Any payments received from worker’s compensation or state disability will result in an equal decrease in disability benefits. Disability benefits are subject to employment withholding provisions. 
The employee is responsible for notifying a supervisor of their disability, expected date of return, and the name of their attending physician. The company may request that an independent medical provider perform an examination. In addition, the company may require a medical release form prior to returning to work. For more information regarding disability benefits, contact [enter authorized person’s name]. If there are any inconsistencies between this handbook and any of the Summary Plan Descriptions, the Summary Plan Descriptions shall govern. The company reserves the right to modify or terminate any or all of the benefits or to change benefit providers at any time with or without notice. 

Section 11 - Termination 
11.1 Voluntary Termination 
The company recognizes that personal situations may arise which require a voluntary termination of employment. Should this occur, the company requests that the employee provide two weeks advance notice in writing. This request does not alter an employee’s at-will relationship with the company. 
All rights and privileges of employment with the company terminate upon the date of separation. As further discussed in Section 8.3, terminating employees are required to return all company property assigned to them. Failure to do so may result in the withholding of their final paycheck. 
11.2 Final Paycheck 
Employees who terminate employment with the company will be given their final pay check  according to state law. Should the employee be unable to personally retrieve their paycheck, it will be mailed to the address on file. 
11.3 COBRA Continuation of Health Benefits 
Under the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), a qualified employee who terminates employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct on the employee’s part) or who loses health and dental coverage due to a reduction in work hours may temporarily continue group health and dental coverage for him/herself, his/her spouse, and any covered dependent children at the full premium rate plus administrative fees. That eligibility normally extends for a period of eighteen (18) months from the qualifying date. For more information regarding COBRA health insurance benefits, see {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. 
11.4 Exit Interview

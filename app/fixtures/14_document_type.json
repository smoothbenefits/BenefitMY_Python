I understand and acknowledge that, except as may be otherwise explicitly provided in a separate written agreement between the Company and me, my Relationship with the Company is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law, meaning that either I or the Company may terminate the Relationship at any time for any reason or no reason, without further obligation or liability, other than those provisions of this Agreement that explicitly continue in effect after the termination of the Relationship.\n      10.   Representations and Covenants.\n            (a) Facilitation of Agreement.

I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement does not and will not breach any agreement I have entered into, or will enter into, with any third party, including without limitation any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information or materials acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to or during the Relationship.  I will not disclose to the Company or use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  I will not induce the Company to use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information, or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  I acknowledge and agree that I have listed on Exhibit?A all agreements (e.g., non-competition agreements, non-solicitation of customers agreements, non-solicitation of employees agreements, confidentiality agreements, inventions agreements, etc.), if any, with a current or former client, employer, or any other person or entity, that may restrict my ability to accept employment with the Company or my ability to recruit or engage customers or service providers on behalf of the Company, or otherwise relate to or restrict my ability to perform my duties for the Company or any obligation I may have to the Company.  I agree not to enter into any written or oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.\n            (c) Voluntary Execution.  I certify and acknowledge that I have carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, that I understand and have voluntarily accepted such provisions, and that I will fully and faithfully comply with such provisions.\n      11.   Electronic Delivery.  Nothing herein is intended to imply a right to participate in any of the Company?s equity incentive plans, however, if I do participate in such plan(s), the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to my participation in the Company?s equity incentive plan(s) by electronic means or to request my consent to participate in such plan(s) by electronic means.  I hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree, if applicable, to participate in such plan(s) through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.\n      12.   Miscellaneous.\n            (a) Governing Law.  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.\n            (b) Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and me relating to its subject matter and merges all prior discussions between us.  No amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties to this Agreement.  The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any rights or remedies it may have in law or equity, nor to have given any authorizations or waived any of its rights under this Agreement, unless, and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, it being understood that, even if I am an officer of the Company, I will not have authority to give any such authorizations or waivers for the Company under this Agreement without specific approval by the Board of Directors.  Any subsequent change or changes in my duties, obligations, rights or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.\n            (c) Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement will be binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, and my successors and assigns, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.\n            (d) Notices.  Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such party?s address as set forth on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice, or if no address is specified on the signature page, at the most recent address set forth in the Company?s books and records. \n            (e) Severability.  If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.  The Company and I have attempted to limit my right to use, maintain and disclose the Company?s Confidential Information, and to limit my right to solicit employees and customers only to the extent necessary to protect the Company from unfair competition.  Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section?8 exceeds the maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the parties intend that the court should reform, modify and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time.   \n            (f) Remedies.  I acknowledge and agree that violation of this Agreement by me may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore I agree that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, I agree that a $1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.\n            (g) Advice of Counsel.  I acknowledge THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, I Have HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND I Have read and understood ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.\n            (h) Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. \n[Signature Page Follows]\n      \nThe parties have executed this Agreement on the respective dates set forth below, to be effective as of the Effective Date first above written.\n\nEXHIBIT?B \nTERMINATION CERTIFICATION\n      This is to certify that I do not have in my possession, nor have I failed to return, any devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, flow charts, materials, equipment, other documents or property, or copies or reproductions of any aforementioned items belonging to {{CompanyName}}, a Delaware corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, the ?Company?).\n      I further certify that I have complied with all the terms of the Company?s Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement signed by me, including the reporting of any Inventions (as defined therein), conceived or made by me (solely or jointly with others) covered by that agreement, and I acknowledge my continuing obligations under that agreement.\n      I further agree that, in compliance with the Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, I will preserve as confidential all trade secrets, confidential knowledge, data or other proprietary information relating to products, processes, know-how, designs, formulas, developmental or experimental work, computer programs, data bases, other original works of authorship, customer lists, business plans, financial information or other subject matter pertaining to any business of the Company or any of its employees, clients, consultants or licensees.\n      I further agree that for twelve (12) months from the date of this Certification, I shall not either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company?s employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the Company, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or consultants of the Company, either for myself or for any other person or entity.\n      Further, I agree that I shall not use any Confidential Information of the Company to negatively influence any of the Company?s clients or customers from purchasing Company products or services or to solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.\n      Further, I acknowledge that the Company has valuable Trade Secrets (as defined by applicable law from time to time) to which I have had access.

      "default_content": "** Continuation Coverage Rights Under COBRA **\n\nIntroduction\n\nYou’re getting this notice because you recently gained coverage under a group health plan (the Plan).  This notice has important information about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a temporary extension of coverage under the Plan.  This notice explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect your right to get it.  When you become eligible for COBRA, you may also become eligible for other coverage options that may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage.\n\nThe right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).  COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you and other members of your family when group health coverage would otherwise end.  For more information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan’s Summary Plan Description or contact the Plan Administrator.  \n\nYou may have other options available to you when you lose group health coverage.  For example, you may be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace.  By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, you may qualify for lower costs on your monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs.  Additionally, you may qualify for a 30-day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which you are eligible (such as a spouse’s plan), even if that plan generally doesn’t accept late enrollees.  \n\nWhat is COBRA continuation coverage?\n\nCOBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when it would otherwise end because of a life event.  This is also called a “qualifying event.”  Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice.  After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a “qualified beneficiary.”  You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event.  Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage.  \n\nIf you’re an employee, you’ll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* Your hours of employment are reduced, or\n* Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct.\n\nIf you’re the spouse of an employee, you’ll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* Your spouse dies;\n* Your spouse’s hours of employment are reduced;\n* Your spouse’s employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;  \n* Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or\n* You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse.\n\nYour dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* The parent-employee dies;\n* The parent-employee’s hours of employment are reduced;\n* The parent-employee’s employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;\n* The parent-employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both);\n* The parents become divorced or legally separated; or\n* The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a “dependent child.”\n\nWhen is COBRA continuation coverage available?\n\nThe Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred.  The employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the following qualifying events:\n* The end of employment or reduction of hours of employment; \n* Death of the employee; \n* [add if Plan provides retiree health coverage:  Commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer;]; or \n* The employee’s becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both).\n\nFor all other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child’s losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), you must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs.  You must provide this notice to: HR at {{CompanyName}}. \n\nHow is COBRA continuation coverage provided?\n\nOnce the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries.  Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage.  Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children.  \n\nCOBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage that generally lasts for 18 months due to employment termination or reduction of hours of work. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of coverage, may permit a beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of coverage.\n\nThere are also ways in which this 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended:  \n\nDisability extension of 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage\n\nIf you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by Social Security to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to get up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 29 months.  The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage. \n\nSecond qualifying event extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage\n\nIf your family experiences another qualifying event during the 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if the Plan is properly notified about the second qualifying event.  This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children getting COBRA continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies; becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); gets divorced or legally separated; or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child.  This extension is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred.\n\nAre there other coverage options besides COBRA Continuation Coverage?\n\nYes.  Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse’s plan) through what is called a “special enrollment period.”   Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage.   You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov.\n\nIf you have questions\n\nQuestions concerning your Plan or your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the contact or contacts identified below.  For more information about your rights under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), including COBRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional or District Office of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) in your area or visit www.dol.gov/ebsa.  (Addresses and phone numbers of Regional and District EBSA Offices are available through EBSA’s website.)  For more information about the Marketplace, visit www.HealthCare.gov.  \n\nKeep your Plan informed of address changes\n\nTo protect your family’s rights, let the Plan Administrator know about any changes in the addresses of family members.  You should also keep a copy, for your records, of any notices you send to the Plan Administrator.\n\nPlan contact information\n\nPlease contact HR person at {{CompanyName}} and/or the broker of {{CompanyName}}.

It is not all- inclusive or intended to provide strict interpretations of our policies; rather, it offers an overview of the work environment. This handbook is not a contract, expressed or implied, guarantying employment for any length of time and is not intended to induce an employee to accept employment with the company. \nThe company reserves the right to unilaterally revise, suspend, revoke, terminate or change any of its policies, in whole or in part, whether described within this handbook or elsewhere, in its sole discretion. If any discrepancy between this handbook and current company policy arises, conform to current company policy. Every effort will be made to keep you informed of the company’s policies, however we cannot guarantee that notice of revisions will be provided. Feel free to ask questions about any of the information within this handbook. \nThis handbook supersedes and replaces any and all personnel policies and manuals previously distributed, made available or applicable to employees. \n1.3 At-Will Employment \nEmployment at this company is at-will. An at-will employment relationship can be terminated at any time, with or without reason or notice by either the employer or the employee. This at-will employment relationship exists regardless of any statements by office personnel to the contrary. Only {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}} is authorized to modify the at-will nature of the employment relationship, and the modification must be in writing. \n\nSection 2 – Workplace Commitments \n2.1 Equal Opportunity Employment \nThis company is an equal opportunity employer and does not unlawfully discriminate against employees or applicants for employment on the basis of an individual’s race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law. This policy applies to all terms, conditions and privileges of employment, including recruitment, hiring, placement, compensation, promotion, discipline and termination. \nWhenever possible, the company makes reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities to the extent required by law. Employees who would like to request a reasonable accommodation should contact {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. \n2.2 Non-Harassment Policy / Non-Discrimination Policy \nThis company prohibits discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law. Each individual has the right to work in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and is free from discriminatory practices, including without limitation harassment. Consistent with its workplace policy of equal employment opportunity, the company prohibits and will not tolerate harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status or any other status protected by applicable law. Violations of this policy will not be tolerated. \nDiscrimination includes, but is not limited to: making any employment decision or employment related action on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, age, sex, disability, national origin, marital or veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law. \nHarassment is generally defined as unwelcome verbal or non-verbal conduct, based upon a person’s protected characteristic, that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward the person because of the characteristic, and which affects the person’s employment opportunities or benefits, has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the person’s work performance, or has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets; slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation in the workplace of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group based on their protected characteristic. \nSexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when: \n- submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment; \n- submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or \n- such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. \nExamples of sexual harassment include: unwelcome or unsolicited sexual advances; displaying sexually suggestive material; unwelcome sexual flirtations, advances or propositions; suggestive comments; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; sexually oriented jokes; crude or vulgar language or gestures; graphic or verbal commentaries about an individual’s body; display or distribution of obscene materials; physical contact such as patting, pinching or brushing against someone’s body; or physical assault of a sexual nature. \nReporting:\nAny company employee who feels that he or she has been harassed or discriminated against, or has witnessed or become aware of discrimination or harassment in violation of these policies, should bring the matter to the immediate attention of his or her supervisor or [enter name of alternative person to whom employees can report]. The company will promptly investigate all allegations of discrimination and harassment, and take action as appropriate based on the outcome of the investigation. An investigation and its results will be treated as confidential to the extent feasible, and the company will take appropriate action based on the outcome of the investigation. \nNo employee will be retaliated against for making a complaint in good faith regarding a violation of these policies, or for participating in good faith in an investigation pursuant to these policies. If an employee feels he/she has been retaliated against, the employee should file a complaint using the procedures set forth above. \n2.3 Drug-Free / Alcohol-Free Environment \nEmployees are prohibited from unlawfully consuming, distributing, possessing, selling, or using controlled substances while on duty. In addition, employees may not be under the influence of any controlled substance, such as drugs or alcohol, while at work, on company premises or engaged in company business. Prescription drugs or over-the- counter medications, taken as prescribed, are an exception to this policy. \nAnyone violating this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. \n\n2.4 Open Door Policy \nThe company has an open door policy and takes employee concerns and problems seriously. The company values each employee and strives to provide a positive work experience. Employees are encouraged to bring any workplace concerns or problems they might have or know about to their supervisor or some other member of management. \n \nSection 3 – Company Policies and Procedures \n3.1 Professional Conduct \nThis company expects its employees to adhere to a standard of professional conduct and integrity. This ensures that the work environment is safe, comfortable and productive. Employees should be respectful, courteous, and mindful of others’ feelings and needs. General cooperation between coworkers and supervisors is expected. Individuals who act in an unprofessional manner may be subject to disciplinary action. \n3.2 Dress Code \nAn employee’s personal appearance and hygiene is a reflection on the company’s character. Employees are expected to dress appropriately for their individual work responsibilities and position. \n3.3 Payday \nPaychecks are distributed every month. If the pay date lands on a holiday, paychecks will be distributed on the closest business day before the holiday. \nPaychecks include salary or wages earned less any mandatory or elected deductions. Mandatory deductions include federal or state withholding tax, and other withholdings. Elected deductions are deductions authorized by the employee, and may include, for example, contributions to benefit plans. Employees may contact [enter authorized person’s name] to obtain the necessary authorization forms for requesting additional deductions from their paychecks. \nNotify a supervisor if the paycheck appears to be inaccurate or if it has been misplaced. The company reserves the right to charge a replacement fee for any lost paychecks. Advances on paychecks are not permitted. Information regarding final paychecks can be found under the termination section of this handbook. \nAny change in name, address, telephone number, marital status or number of exemptions claimed by an employee must be reported to {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}  immediately. \n\n3.4 Company Property \nCompany property, such as equipment, vehicles, telephones, computers, and software, is not for private use. These devices are to be used strictly for company business, and are not permitted off grounds unless authorized. Company property must be used in the manner for which it was intended. Upon termination, employees are required to surrender any company property they possess. \nCompany computers, internet and emails are a privileged resource, and must be used only to complete essential job-related functions. Employees are not permitted to download any “pirated” software, files or programs and must receive permission from a supervisor before installing any new software on a company computer. Files or programs stored on company computers may not be copied for personal use. \nPhones are provided for business use. The company requests that employees not receive personal calls while on duty. If urgent, please keep personal calls to a minimum and conversations brief. Personal long distance calls are not permitted. \nEmployees are reminded that they should have no expectation of privacy in their use of company computers or other electronic equipment. \nViolations of these policies could result in disciplinary action. \n \n3.5 Privacy \nEmployees and employers share a relationship based on trust and mutual respect. However, the company retains the right to access all company property including computers, desks, file cabinets, storage facilities, and files and folders, electronic or otherwise, at any time. Employees should not entertain any expectations of privacy when on company grounds or while using company property. \nAll documents, files, voice-mails and electronic information, including e-mails and other communications, created, received or maintained on or through company property are the property of the company, not the employee. Therefore employees should have no expectation of privacy over those files or documents. \n3.6 Personnel Files \nThe company maintains a personnel file on each employee. These files are kept confidential to the extent possible. Employees may review their personnel file upon request. \nIt is important that personnel files accurately reflect each employee’s personal information. Employees are expected to inform the company of any change in name, address, home phone number, home address, marital status, number of dependents or emergency contact information. \n \nSection 4 - Employment Classification \nThis company assigns positions, determines wages and compensates employees for overtime in accordance with state and local laws and the Fair Labor Standards Act. \n4.1 ExemptEmployees \nExempt employees are those that are excluded from the overtime pay requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Exempt employees are paid a salary and are expected to work beyond their normal work hours whenever necessary to accomplish the work of the company. Exempt employees are not eligible to receive overtime compensation. Employees should consult with an administrator if they have questions regarding their classification as an exempt employee. \n4.2 Non-Exempt Employees \nNon-exempt employees are those eligible for overtime pay of 1.5 times the regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 per work week. All overtime must be approved in advance. Employees should consult with an administrator if they have questions regarding their classification as a non-exempt employee. \n \n4.3 Part Time, Full Time or Temporary Status \nPart-time or full-time status depends on the number of hours per week an employee works. Regular employees who work fewer than 40 hours receive part-time classification. Part-time employees are not eligible for employee benefits as described in this handbook. Regular employees who work at least 40 hours receive full-time classification. \nFrom time to time the company may hire employees for specific projects or periods of time. Temporary employees may work either part-time or full-time, but generally are scheduled to terminate by a certain date. Temporary employees who remain on duty past the scheduled termination remain classified as temporary. Only {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}} may change an employee’s temporary status. Temporary employees are not eligible for employment benefits. \n\nSection 5 – Attendance Policies \n5.1 GeneralAttendance \nThe company maintains normal working hours of 8-5. Hours may vary depending on work location and job responsibilities. Supervisors will provide employees with their work schedule. Should an employee have any questions regarding his/her work schedule, the employee should contact the supervisor. \nThe company does not tolerate absenteeism without excuse. Employees who will be late to or absent from work should notify a supervisor in advance, or as soon as practicable in the event of an emergency. Chronic absenteeism may result in disciplinary action. \nEmployees who need to leave early, for illness or otherwise, should inform a supervisor before departure. Unauthorized departures may result in disciplinary action. \n5.2 Tardiness \nEmployees are expected to arrive on time and ready for work. An employee who arrives 60 minutes after their scheduled arrival time is considered tardy. The company recognizes that situations arise which hinder punctuality; regardless, excessive tardiness is prohibited, and may be subject to disciplinary action. \n5.3 Breaks \nWhen working conditions permit, and pending a supervisor’s approval, employees are entitled to 15 minute breaks for every two hours worked. \nMeal periods are for 60 minutes, and must be approved by a supervisor. \n\nSection 6 – Leave Policies \n6.1 Vacations \nThe company provides, as a benefit, paid vacations for its eligible employees. Forward requests for time off in advance to a supervisor, who may approve or deny the request based on company resources. The company is flexible in approving time off when doing so would not interfere with company operations. Vacation days are granted only on a full day or half-day basis. \nA regular employee is eligible to receive paid time off after [enter number] months of full-time service. Accrued time off may be taken after [enter eligibility dates]. Employees must earn and accrue vacation benefits before they may be used. Employees should consult {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}} regarding the amount of vacation leave they accrue each pay period. \nAny remaining accrued time off may not be accumulated or carried forward into the next year. Vacation benefits do not accrue during any period of extended leave of absence. \n6.2 Sick Leave \nSituations may arise where an employee needs to take time off to address medical or other health concerns. The company requests that employees provide notification to their supervisor as soon as practicable when taking time off. Sick days are granted on an unpaid basis to regular employees. Employees may consult {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}} regarding the amount of (paid) sick leave provided each year. Sick days may not be carried over into the next year. Abuse of this policy may result in disciplinary action. \n6.3 Family and Medical Leave Act Leave \nThe company offers leave consistent with the requirements of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Under the FMLA, an employee may be eligible for an  \nunpaid family and medical leave of absence under certain circumstances, if the employee works within a seventy-five (75) mile radius of fifty (50) or more company employees. \nUnder the federal FMLA, a person who has worked as an employee of this company for at least 1,250 hours for twelve months is eligible for FMLA leave. Up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave per year is available for the following reasons: \n-  The birth of a child and to care for the newborn child; \n-  Placement of a child into adoptive or foster care with the employee; \n-  Care for a spouse, son, daughter or parent who has a serious health condition; or \n-  Care for the employee’s own serious health condition. \nIf the need for leave is foreseeable, employees should notify a supervisor 30 days prior to taking FMLA leave. If the need for FMLA leave arises unexpectedly, employees should notify a supervisor as soon as practicable, giving as much notice to the company as possible. \nEmployees may be required to provide: medical certifications supporting the need for leave if the leave is due to a serious health condition of the employee or employee’s family member; periodic recertification of the serious health condition; and periodic reports during the leave regarding the employee’s status and intent to return to work. Employees must return to work immediately after the serious health condition ceases, and employees who have taken leave because of their own serious health condition must submit a fitness-for-duty certification before being allowed to return to work. \nLeave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced schedule to care for an illness; yet, may not be taken intermittently for the care of a newborn or newly adopted child. When leave is taken intermittently, the company may transfer the employee to another position with equivalent pay and benefits, which is better suited to periods of absence. \nSubject to certain conditions, the employee or the company may choose to use accrued paid leave (such as sick leave or vacation leave) concurrent with FMLA leave. \nThe company will maintain group health insurance coverage for an employee on family and medical leave on the same terms as if the employee had continued work. If applicable, arrangements will be made for the employee to pay their share of health insurance premiums while on leave. The company may recover premiums paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from family and medical leave. \n\nIf an employee would like the company to maintain other paid benefits during the period of leave, premiums and charges which are partially or wholly paid by the employee must continue to be paid by the employee during the leave time. \nFamily and medical leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commenced. However, an employee on family and medical leave does not continue to accrue benefits (e.g., sick leave or vacation leave) during the period of family and medical leave. Questions regarding particular benefits should be directed to {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. \nUpon returning from FMLA leave, an employee will be restored to his/her original job or an equivalent job with equivalent benefits, pay, seniority, and other employment terms and conditions as provided by the Family and Medical Leave Act. \n6.4 Holidays \nThe company observes the following holidays: \n-  New Year’s Day \n-  Martin Luther King, Jr. Day \n-  Memorial Day \n-  Independence Day \n-  Labor Day \n-  Thanksgiving \n-  Christmas Day \nand other holidays that are mandated holidays by the state.\nHolidays are observed on a [paid/unpaid] basis for all eligible employees. [Full time employees are eligible for paid holiday benefits.] \n6.5 Jury Duty Time Off \nThe company understands that occasionally employees are called to serve on a jury. Employees who are selected for jury duty must provide a copy of their jury summons to a supervisor. Time taken for jury duty is granted on an unpaid basis. Employees released from jury duty with 4 hours remaining in the workday, are expected to return to work. \n6.6 Voting Time Off \nEmployees are encouraged to participate in elections. The company grants incremental time off to cast a ballot in an election. Voting time off is granted on an unpaid basis. Should extenuating circumstances arise while voting, notify a supervisor as soon as possible. \n6.7 Military Leave \nEmployees called to active military duty, military reserve or National Guard service may be eligible to receive time off under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994. To receive time off, employees must provide notice and a copy of their report orders to an immediate supervisor. Military leave is granted on an unpaid basis. Upon return with an honorable discharge, an employee may be entitled to reinstatement and any applicable job benefits they would have received if present, to the extent provided by law. \n \n6.8 Leave of Absence \nRegular full-time employees may request an unpaid leave of absence after the exhaustion of paid leave. A request for a leave of absence must be submitted in writing in advance to the employee''s immediate supervisor. \nLeave of absences that are granted are unpaid, and will not be considered until an employee has exhausted all appropriate accrued leave balances. Continuation of employee benefits during a leave of absence will be addressed on an individual basis, as required by law. \n \nSection 7 – Work Performance \n7.1 Expectations \nThe company expects every employee to act in a professional manner. Satisfactory performance of job duties and responsibilities is key to this expectation. Employees should attempt to achieve their job objectives, and act with diligence and consideration at all times. Poor job performance can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. \n7.2 Reviews\nThe company may periodically evaluate an employee’s performance. The goal of a performance review is to identify areas where an employee excels and areas that need improvement. The company uses performance reviews as a tool to determine pay increases, promotions and/or terminations. \nAll performance reviews are based on merit, achievement and other factors may include but are not limited to: \n-  Quality of work \n-  Attitude \n-  Knowledge of work \n-  Job skills \n-  Attendance and punctuality \n-  Teamwork and cooperation \n-  Compliance with company policy \n-  Past performance reviews \n-  Improvement \n-  Acceptance of responsibility and constructive feedback \nEmployees should note that a performance review does not guarantee a pay increase or promotion. Written performance evaluations may be made at any time to advise employees of unacceptable performance. Evaluations or any subsequent change in employment status, position or pay does not alter the employee’s at will-relationship with the company. \nForward any questions about performance expectation or evaluation to the supervisor conducting the evaluation. \n7.3 Insubordination \nSupervisors and employees should interact with mutual respect and common courtesy. Employees are expected to take instruction from supervisors or other persons of authority. Failure to comply with instructions or unreasonably delaying compliance is considered insubordination. Acts of insubordination are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. \nIf an employee disagrees with a supervisor, the employee should first try to mediate the situation by explaining their position. If possible, a compromise might be met and accusations of insubordination avoided. \n\nSection 8 – Discipline Policy \n8.1 Grounds for Disciplinary Action \nThe company reserves the right to discipline and/or terminate any employee who violates company polices, practices or rules of conduct. Poor performance and misconduct are also grounds for discipline or termination. \nThe following actions are unacceptable and considered grounds for disciplinary action. This list is not comprehensive; rather, it is meant merely as an example of the types of conduct that this company does not tolerate. These actions include, but are not limited to: \n-  Engaging in acts of discrimination or harassment in the workplace; \n-  Possessing, distributing or being under the influence of illicit controlled \nsubstances; \n-  Being under the influence of a controlled substance or alcohol at work, on \ncompany premises, or while engaged in company business; \n-  Unauthorized use of company property, equipment, devices or assets; \n-  Damage, destruction or theft of company property, equipment, devices or assets; \n-  Removing company property without prior authorization or disseminating \ncompany information without authorization; \n-  Falsification, misrepresentation or omission of information, documents or records; \n-  Lying; \n-  Insubordination or refusal to comply with directives; \n-  Failing to adequately perform job responsibilities; \n-  Excessive or unexcused absenteeism or tardiness; \n-  Disclosing confidential or proprietary company information without permission; \n-  Illegal or violent activity; \n-  Falsifying injury reports or reasons for leave; \n-  Possessing unauthorized weapons on premises; \n-  Disregard for safety and security procedures; \n-  Disparaging or disrespecting supervisors and/or co-workers; and \n-  Any other action or conduct that is inconsistent with company policies, \nprocedures, standards or expectations. \nThis list exhibits the types of actions or events that are subject to disciplinary action. It is not intended to indicate every act that could lead to disciplinary action. The company reserves the right to determine the severity and extent of any disciplinary action based on the circumstances of each case. \n8.2 Procedures \nDisciplinary action is any one of a number of options used to correct unacceptable behavior or actions. Discipline may take the form of oral warnings, written warnings, probation, suspension, demotion, discharge, removal or some other disciplinary action, in no particular order. The course of action will be determined by the company at its sole discretion as it deems appropriate. \n8.3 Termination \nEmployment with the company is on an at-will basis and may be terminated voluntarily or involuntarily at any time. \nUpon termination, an employee is required: \n-  to continue to work until the last scheduled day of employment; \n-  to turn in all reports and paperwork required to be completed by the employee when due and no later than the last day of work; \n-  to return all files, documents, equipment, keys, access cards, software or other property belonging to the company that are in the employee’s possession, custody or control, and turn in all passwords to his/her supervisor; \n-  to participate in an exit interview as requested by [enter authorized person’s name]. \n \nSection 9 – Health and Safety \n9.1 Workplace Safety \nThe company takes every reasonable precaution to ensure that employees have a safe working environment. Safety measures and rules are in place for the protection of all employees. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of each employee to help prevent accidents. To ensure the continuation of a safe workplace, all employees should review and understand all provisions of the company’s workplace safety policy. Employees should use all safety and protective equipment provided to them, and maintain work areas in a safe and orderly manner, free from hazardous conditions. Employees who observe an unsafe practice or condition should report it to a supervisor or [enter alternate name] immediately. Employees are prohibited from making threats against anyone in connection with his/her work or engaging in violent activities while in the employ of the company. Any questions regarding safety and safe practices should be directed to {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. \nIn the event of an accident, employees must notify a supervisor immediately. Report every injury, regardless of how minor, to a supervisor immediately. Physical discomfort caused by repetitive tasks must also be reported. For more information about on the job injuries, refer to the worker’s compensation section of this handbook. \nEmployees should recognize any potential fire hazards and be aware of fire escape routes and fire drills. Do not block fire exits, tamper with fire extinguishers or otherwise create fire hazards. \n9.2 Workplace Security \nEmployees must be alert and aware of any potential dangers to themselves or their coworkers. Take every precaution to ensure that your surroundings are safe and secure. Guard personal belongings and company property. Visitors should be escorted at all times.

If you hear a fire alarm or other emergency alert system, proceed quickly and calmly to the nearest exit. Once the building has been evacuated, only a supervisor may authorize employees to reenter. \n\nSection 10 - Employee Benefits \nThis handbook contains descriptions of some of our current employee benefits. Many of the company’s benefit plans are described in more formal plan documents available from {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. In the event of any inconsistencies between this handbook or any other oral or written description of benefits and a formal plan document, the formal plan document will govern. \n10.1 Health Insurance \nThe company makes group health benefits available to eligible employees and their family members. Eligible employees are full time employees who have worked for 12 months. Part time employees are eligible if they work at least 30 hours per week and have been employed for 12 months. \nHealth benefits are paid in part by the company. The remainder of the costs is the employee’s responsibility. Employees can receive details about benefits provided, contribution rates and eligibility from {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. \n10.2 RetirementPlan \nThe company participates in a 401(k) plan so that employees may save a portion of their earnings for retirement. Regular employees who have worked at least 40 hours/week for 12 months are eligible to participate. Employees may elect to make regular contributions to the 401(k) plan up to the maximum amount allowed by federal law. \nContact {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}} for detailed information regarding eligibility, employee contributions, vesting period or employer contributions. More information can also be found in the plan summary description, which is available from {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. If there are any inconsistencies between this handbook and any of the Summary Plan Descriptions, the Summary Plan Descriptions shall govern. The company reserves the right to modify or terminate any or all of its retirement benefits or to change benefit providers at any time with or without notice. \n10.3 Workers’ Compensation \nAs required by law, the company provides workers’ compensation benefits for the protection of employees with work-related injuries or illnesses. \nWorkers’ compensation insurance provides coverage to employees who receive job- related injuries or illnesses. If an employee is injured or becomes ill as a result of his/her job, it is the employee’s responsibility to immediately notify a supervisor of their injury in order to receive benefits. Report every illness or injury to a supervisor, regardless of how minor it appears. The company will advise the employee of the procedure for submitting a workers’ compensation claim. If necessary, injured employees will be referred to a medical care facility. Employees should retain all paperwork provided to them by the medical facility. Failure to report a work-related illness or injury promptly could result in denial of benefits. An employee’s report should contain as many details as possible, including the date, time, description of the illness or injury, and the names of any witnesses. \nA separate insurance company administers the worker’s compensation insurance. Representatives of this company may contact injured employees regarding their benefits under the plan. Additional information regarding workers’ compensation is available from {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. \n10.4 Disability Coverage \nDisability insurance provides partial paycheck reimbursement for times of serious illness or injury which leads to total disability. Total disability is defined as the inability to perform any job function as a result of the injury or illness. Employees who have worked for 12 months are eligible for disability insurance coverage. To qualify for benefits, the period of total disability must exceed 30 days. \n \nCoverage extends for 30 days of disability. Employees must exhaust any sick leave benefits before being eligible for disability leave coverage. \nDisability benefits are calculated as a percentage of an employees base salary as defined by the state law. Any payments received from worker’s compensation or state disability will result in an equal decrease in disability benefits. Disability benefits are subject to employment withholding provisions. \nThe employee is responsible for notifying a supervisor of their disability, expected date of return, and the name of their attending physician. The company may request that an independent medical provider perform an examination. In addition, the company may require a medical release form prior to returning to work. For more information regarding disability benefits, contact [enter authorized person’s name]. If there are any inconsistencies between this handbook and any of the Summary Plan Descriptions, the Summary Plan Descriptions shall govern. The company reserves the right to modify or terminate any or all of the benefits or to change benefit providers at any time with or without notice. \n\nSection 11 - Termination \n11.1 Voluntary Termination \nThe company recognizes that personal situations may arise which require a voluntary termination of employment. Should this occur, the company requests that the employee provide two weeks advance notice in writing. This request does not alter an employee’s at-will relationship with the company. \nAll rights and privileges of employment with the company terminate upon the date of separation. As further discussed in Section 8.3, terminating employees are required to return all company property assigned to them. Failure to do so may result in the withholding of their final paycheck. \n11.2 Final Paycheck \nEmployees who terminate employment with the company will be given their final pay check  according to state law. Should the employee be unable to personally retrieve their paycheck, it will be mailed to the address on file. \n11.3 COBRA Continuation of Health Benefits \nUnder the federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), a qualified employee who terminates employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct on the employee’s part) or who loses health and dental coverage due to a reduction in work hours may temporarily continue group health and dental coverage for him/herself, his/her spouse, and any covered dependent children at the full premium rate plus administrative fees. That eligibility normally extends for a period of eighteen (18) months from the qualifying date. For more information regarding COBRA health insurance benefits, see {{COMPANYHRMANAGERNAME}}. \n11.4 Exit Interview \nThe company may request an exit interview upon notice of termination.

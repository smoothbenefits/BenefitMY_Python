I understand that my listing of any Inventions on Exhibit?A does not constitute an acknowledgement by the Company of the existence or extent of such Inventions, nor of my ownership of such Inventions.  I further understand that I must receive the formal approval of the Company before commencing my Relationship with the Company.\n            (b) Use or Incorporation of Inventions.  If in the course of the Relationship, I use or incorporate into a product, service, process or machine any Invention not covered by Section?4(d) of this Agreement in which I have an interest, I will promptly so inform the Company in writing.  Whether or not I give such notice, I hereby irrevocably grant to the Company a nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, assumable, perpetual, worldwide license, with right to transfer and to sublicense, to practice and exploit such Invention and to make, have made, copy, modify, make derivative works of, use, sell, import, and otherwise distribute such Invention under all applicable intellectual property laws without restriction of any kind.\n            (c) Inventions.  I understand that ?Inventions? means discoveries, developments, concepts, designs, ideas, know how, improvements, inventions, trade secrets and/or original works of authorship, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable.  I understand this includes, but is not limited to, any new product, machine, article of manufacture, biological material, method, procedure, process, technique, use, equipment, device, apparatus, system, compound, formulation, composition of matter, design or configuration of any kind, or any improvement thereon.  I understand that ?Company Inventions? means any and all Inventions that I may solely or jointly author, discover, develop, conceive, or reduce to practice during the period of the Relationship, except as otherwise provided in Section?4(g) below.\n            (d) Assignment of Company Inventions.  I agree that I will promptly make full written disclosure to the Company, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company, and hereby assign to the Company, or its designee, all my right, title and interest throughout the world in and to any and all Company Inventions and all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights therein.  I hereby waive and irrevocably quitclaim to the Company or its designee any and all claims, of any nature whatsoever, that I now have or may hereafter have for infringement of any and all Company Inventions.  I further acknowledge that all Company Inventions that are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of and during the period of the Relationship are ?works made for hire? (to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law) and are compensated by my salary.  Any assignment of Company Inventions includes all rights of attribution, paternity, integrity, modification, disclosure and withdrawal, and any other rights throughout the world that may be known as or referred to as ?moral rights,? ?artist?s rights,? ?droit moral,? or the like (collectively, ?Moral Rights?).  To the extent that Moral Rights cannot be assigned under applicable law, I hereby waive and agree not to enforce any and all Moral Rights, including, without limitation, any limitation on subsequent modification, to the extent permitted under applicable law.\n            (e) Maintenance of Records.  I agree to keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Company Inventions made or conceived by me (solely or jointly with others) during the term of the Relationship.  The records may be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic data or recordings, laboratory notebooks, or any other format.  The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times.  I agree not to remove such records from the Company?s place of business except as expressly permitted by Company policy which may, from time to time, be revised at the sole election of the Company for the purpose of furthering the Company?s business.  I agree to deliver all such records (including any copies thereof) to the Company at the time of termination of the Relationship as provided for in Section?5 and Section?6.\n            (f) Patent and Copyright Rights.  I agree to assist the Company, or its designee, at its expense, in every proper way to secure the Company?s, or its designee?s, rights in the Company Inventions and any copyrights, patents, trademarks, mask work rights, Moral Rights, or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company or its designee of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, recordations, and all other instruments which the Company or its designee shall deem necessary in order to apply for, obtain, maintain and transfer such rights, or if not transferable, waive and agree never to assert such rights, and in order to assign and convey to the Company or its designee, and any successors, assigns and nominees the sole and exclusive right, title and interest in and to such Company Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto.  I further agree that my obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in my power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue during and at all times after the end of the Relationship and until the expiration of the last such intellectual property right to expire in any country of the world.  I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such instruments and papers and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the application for, prosecution, issuance, maintenance or transfer of letters patent, copyright, mask work and other registrations related to such Company Inventions.  This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by my subsequent incapacity.\n            (g) Exception to Assignments.  Subject to the requirements of applicable state law, if any, I understand that the Company Inventions will not include, and the provisions of this Agreement requiring assignment of inventions to the Company do not apply to, any invention which qualifies fully for exclusion under the provisions of applicable state law, if any.  In order to assist in the determination of which inventions qualify for such exclusion, I will advise the Company promptly in writing, during and after the term of the Relationship, of all Inventions solely or jointly conceived or developed or reduced to practice by me during the period of the Relationship.\n      5.

Termination Certification.  In the event of the termination of the Relationship, I agree to sign and deliver the ?Termination Certification? attached hereto as Exhibit B; however, my failure to sign and deliver the Termination Certification shall in no way diminish my continuing obligations under this Agreement.\n      7.    Notice to Third Parties.  I agree that during the periods of time during which I am restricted in taking certain actions by the terms of this Agreement (the ?Restriction Period?), I shall inform any entity or person with whom I may seek to enter into a business relationship (whether as an owner, employee, independent contractor or otherwise) of my contractual obligations under this Agreement.  I also understand and agree that the Company may, with or without prior notice to me and during or after the term of the Relationship, notify third parties of my agreements and obligations under this Agreement.  I further agree that, upon written request by the Company, I will respond to the Company in writing regarding the status of my employment or proposed employment with any party during the Restriction Period.\n      8.    Solicitation of Employees, Consultants and Other Parties.  As described above, I acknowledge and agree that the Company?s Confidential Information includes information relating to the Company?s employees, consultants, customers and others, and that I will not use or disclose such Confidential Information except as authorized by the Company.  I further agree as follows:\n            (a) Employees, Consultants. I agree that during the term of the Relationship, and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of the Relationship for any reason, whether with or without cause, I shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company?s employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the Company, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or consultants of the Company, either for myself or for any other person or entity.\n            (b) Other Parties.

In addition, I acknowledge that the Company has valuable Trade Secrets (as defined by applicable law from time to time) to which I will have access during the term of the Relationship.  I understand that the Company intends to vigorously pursue its rights under applicable Trade Secrets law if, during a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of the Relationship for any reason, whether with or without cause, I solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, licensor, licensee, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.  Thereafter, the Company intends to vigorously pursue its rights under applicable Trade Secrets law as the circumstances warrant.\n      9.    At-Will Relationship.  I understand and acknowledge that, except as may be otherwise explicitly provided in a separate written agreement between the Company and me, my Relationship with the Company is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law, meaning that either I or the Company may terminate the Relationship at any time for any reason or no reason, without further obligation or liability, other than those provisions of this Agreement that explicitly continue in effect after the termination of the Relationship.\n      10.   Representations and Covenants.\n            (a) Facilitation of Agreement.

I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement does not and will not breach any agreement I have entered into, or will enter into, with any third party, including without limitation any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information or materials acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to or during the Relationship.  I will not disclose to the Company or use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  I will not induce the Company to use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information, or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  I acknowledge and agree that I have listed on Exhibit?A all agreements (e.g., non-competition agreements, non-solicitation of customers agreements, non-solicitation of employees agreements, confidentiality agreements, inventions agreements, etc.), if any, with a current or former client, employer, or any other person or entity, that may restrict my ability to accept employment with the Company or my ability to recruit or engage customers or service providers on behalf of the Company, or otherwise relate to or restrict my ability to perform my duties for the Company or any obligation I may have to the Company.  I agree not to enter into any written or oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.\n            (c) Voluntary Execution.

I hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree, if applicable, to participate in such plan(s) through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.\n      12.   Miscellaneous.\n            (a) Governing Law.  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.\n            (b) Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and me relating to its subject matter and merges all prior discussions between us.  No amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties to this Agreement.  The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any rights or remedies it may have in law or equity, nor to have given any authorizations or waived any of its rights under this Agreement, unless, and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, it being understood that, even if I am an officer of the Company, I will not have authority to give any such authorizations or waivers for the Company under this Agreement without specific approval by the Board of Directors.  Any subsequent change or changes in my duties, obligations, rights or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.\n            (c) Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement will be binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, and my successors and assigns, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.\n            (d) Notices.  Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such party?s address as set forth on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice, or if no address is specified on the signature page, at the most recent address set forth in the Company?s books and records. \n            (e) Severability.  If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.  The Company and I have attempted to limit my right to use, maintain and disclose the Company?s Confidential Information, and to limit my right to solicit employees and customers only to the extent necessary to protect the Company from unfair competition.  Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section?8 exceeds the maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the parties intend that the court should reform, modify and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time.   \n            (f) Remedies.  I acknowledge and agree that violation of this Agreement by me may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore I agree that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, I agree that a $1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.\n            (g) Advice of Counsel.  I acknowledge THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, I Have HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND I Have read and understood ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.\n            (h) Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. \n[Signature Page Follows]\n      \nThe parties have executed this Agreement on the respective dates set forth below, to be effective as of the Effective Date first above written.\n\nEXHIBIT?B \nTERMINATION CERTIFICATION\n      This is to certify that I do not have in my possession, nor have I failed to return, any devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, flow charts, materials, equipment, other documents or property, or copies or reproductions of any aforementioned items belonging to {{CompanyName}}, a Delaware corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, the ?Company?).\n      I further certify that I have complied with all the terms of the Company?s Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement signed by me, including the reporting of any Inventions (as defined therein), conceived or made by me (solely or jointly with others) covered by that agreement, and I acknowledge my continuing obligations under that agreement.\n      I further agree that, in compliance with the Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, I will preserve as confidential all trade secrets, confidential knowledge, data or other proprietary information relating to products, processes, know-how, designs, formulas, developmental or experimental work, computer programs, data bases, other original works of authorship, customer lists, business plans, financial information or other subject matter pertaining to any business of the Company or any of its employees, clients, consultants or licensees.\n      I further agree that for twelve (12) months from the date of this Certification, I shall not either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company?s employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the Company, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or consultants of the Company, either for myself or for any other person or entity.\n      Further, I agree that I shall not use any Confidential Information of the Company to negatively influence any of the Company?s clients or customers from purchasing Company products or services or to solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.\n      Further, I acknowledge that the Company has valuable Trade Secrets (as defined by applicable law from time to time) to which I have had access.  I understand that the Company intends to vigorously pursue its rights under applicable Trade Secrets law if, during a period of twelve (12) months from the date of this Certification, I solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, licensor, licensee, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.  Thereafter, the Company intends to vigorously pursue its rights under applicable Trade Secrets law as the circumstances warrant.\n      \nthe company:\n{{CompanyName}}\nTitle: {{CompanyHRManagerName}}\n\n\n\nEmployee:  {{EmployeeName}} ", "name": "NDA"}, "model": "app.documenttype", "pk": 3}, {"fields": {"default_content": "** Continuation Coverage Rights Under COBRA **\n\nIntroduction\n\nYou\u2019re getting this notice because you recently gained coverage under a group health plan (the Plan).  This notice has important information about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a temporary extension of coverage under the Plan.  This notice explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect your right to get it.  When you become eligible for COBRA, you may also become eligible for other coverage options that may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage.\n\nThe right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).  COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you and other members of your family when group health coverage would otherwise end.  For more information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan\u2019s Summary Plan Description or contact the Plan Administrator.  \n\nYou may have other options available to you when you lose group health coverage.  For example, you may be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace.  By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, you may qualify for lower costs on your monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs.  Additionally, you may qualify for a 30-day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which you are eligible (such as a spouse\u2019s plan), even if that plan generally doesn\u2019t accept late enrollees.  \n\nWhat is COBRA continuation coverage?\n\nCOBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when it would otherwise end because of a life event.  This is also called a \u201cqualifying event.\u201d  Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice.  After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \u201cqualified beneficiary.\u201d  You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event.  Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage.  \n\nIf you\u2019re an employee, you\u2019ll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* Your hours of employment are reduced, or\n* Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct.\n\nIf you\u2019re the spouse of an employee, you\u2019ll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* Your spouse dies;\n* Your spouse\u2019s hours of employment are reduced;\n* Your spouse\u2019s employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;  \n* Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or\n* You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse.\n\nYour dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* The parent-employee dies;\n* The parent-employee\u2019s hours of employment are reduced;\n* The parent-employee\u2019s employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;\n* The parent-employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both);\n* The parents become divorced or legally separated; or\n* The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a \u201cdependent child.\u201d\n\nWhen is COBRA continuation coverage available?\n\nThe Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred.  The employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the following qualifying events:\n* The end of employment or reduction of hours of employment; \n* Death of the employee; \n* [add if Plan provides retiree health coverage:  Commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer;]; or \n* The employee\u2019s becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both).\n\nFor all other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child\u2019s losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), you must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs.  You must provide this notice to: HR at {{CompanyName}}. \n\nHow is COBRA continuation coverage provided?\n\nOnce the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries.  Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage.  Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children.  \n\nCOBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage that generally lasts for 18 months due to employment termination or reduction of hours of work. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of coverage, may permit a beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of coverage.\n\nThere are also ways in which this 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended:  \n\nDisability extension of 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage\n\nIf you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by Social Security to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to get up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 29 months.  The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage. \n\nSecond qualifying event extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage\n\nIf your family experiences another qualifying event during the 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if the Plan is properly notified about the second qualifying event.  This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children getting COBRA continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies; becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); gets divorced or legally separated; or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child.  This extension is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred.\n\nAre there other coverage options besides COBRA Continuation Coverage?\n\nYes.  Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse\u2019s plan) through what is called a \u201cspecial enrollment period.\u201d   Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage.   You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov.\n\nIf you have questions\n\nQuestions concerning your Plan or your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the contact or contacts identified below.  For more information about your rights under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), including COBRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional or District Office of the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) in your area or visit www.dol.gov/ebsa.  (Addresses and phone numbers of Regional and District EBSA Offices are available through EBSA\u2019s website.)  For more information about the Marketplace, visit www.HealthCare.gov.  \n\nKeep your Plan informed of address changes\n\nTo protect your family\u2019s rights, let the Plan Administrator know about any changes in the addresses of family members.  You should also keep a copy, for your records, of any notices you send to the Plan Administrator.\n\nPlan contact information\n\nPlease contact HR person at {{CompanyName}} and/or the broker of {{CompanyName}}.

"content": "** Continuation Coverage Rights Under COBRA **\n\nIntroduction\n\nYou\u2019re getting this notice because you recently gained coverage under a group health plan (the Plan).  This notice has important information about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a temporary extension of coverage under the Plan.  This notice explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect your right to get it.  When you become eligible for COBRA, you may also become eligible for other coverage options that may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage.\n\nThe right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).  COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you and other members of your family when group health coverage would otherwise end.  For more information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan\u2019s Summary Plan Description or contact the Plan Administrator.  \n\nYou may have other options available to you when you lose group health coverage.  For example, you may be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace.  By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, you may qualify for lower costs on your monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs.  Additionally, you may qualify for a 30-day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which you are eligible (such as a spouse\u2019s plan), even if that plan generally doesn\u2019t accept late enrollees.  \n\nWhat is COBRA continuation coverage?\n\nCOBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when it would otherwise end because of a life event.  This is also called a \u201cqualifying event.\u201d  Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice.  After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \u201cqualified beneficiary.\u201d  You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event.  Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage.  \n\nIf you\u2019re an employee, you\u2019ll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* Your hours of employment are reduced, or\n* Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct.\n\nIf you\u2019re the spouse of an employee, you\u2019ll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* Your spouse dies;\n* Your spouse\u2019s hours of employment are reduced;\n* Your spouse\u2019s employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;  \n* Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or\n* You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse.\n\nYour dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* The parent-employee dies;\n* The parent-employee\u2019s hours of employment are reduced;\n* The parent-employee\u2019s employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;\n* The parent-employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both);\n* The parents become divorced or legally separated; or\n* The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a \u201cdependent child.\u201d\n\nWhen is COBRA continuation coverage available?\n\nThe Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred.  The employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the following qualifying events:\n* The end of employment or reduction of hours of employment; \n* Death of the employee; \n* [add if Plan provides retiree health coverage:  Commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer;]; or \n* The employee\u2019s becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both).\n\nFor all other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child\u2019s losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), you must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs.  You must provide this notice to: HR at BenefitMy Inc.. \n\nHow is COBRA continuation coverage provided?\n\nOnce the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries.  Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage.  Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children.  \n\nCOBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage that generally lasts for 18 months due to employment termination or reduction of hours of work. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of coverage, may permit a beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of coverage.\n\nThere are also ways in which this 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended:  \n\nDisability extension of 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage\n\nIf you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by Social Security to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to get up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 29 months.  The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage. \n\nSecond qualifying event extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage\n\nIf your family experiences another qualifying event during the 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if the Plan is properly notified about the second qualifying event.  This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children getting COBRA continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies; becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); gets divorced or legally separated; or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child.  This extension is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred.\n\nAre there other coverage options besides COBRA Continuation Coverage?\n\nYes.  Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse\u2019s plan) through what is called a \u201cspecial enrollment period.\u201d   Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage.   You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov.\n\nIf you have questions\n\nQuestions concerning your Plan or your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the contact or contacts identified below.  For more information about your rights under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), including COBRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional or District Office of the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) in your area or visit www.dol.gov/ebsa.  (Addresses and phone numbers of Regional and District EBSA Offices are available through EBSA\u2019s website.)  For more information about the Marketplace, visit www.HealthCare.gov.  \n\nKeep your Plan informed of address changes\n\nTo protect your family\u2019s rights, let the Plan Administrator know about any changes in the addresses of family members.  You should also keep a copy, for your records, of any notices you send to the Plan Administrator.\n\nPlan contact information\n\nPlease contact HR person at BenefitMy Inc. and/or the broker of BenefitMy Inc..

(to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law) and are compensated by my salary.  Any assignment of Company Inventions includes all rights of attribution, paternity, integrity, modification, disclosure and withdrawal, and any other rights throughout the world that may be known as or referred to as ?moral rights,? ?artist?s rights,? ?droit moral,? or the like (collectively, ?Moral Rights?).  To the extent that Moral Rights cannot be assigned under applicable law, I hereby waive and agree not to enforce any and all Moral Rights, including, without limitation, any limitation on subsequent modification, to the extent permitted under applicable law.\n            (e) Maintenance of Records.  I agree to keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Company Inventions made or conceived by me (solely or jointly with others) during the term of the Relationship.  The records may be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, flow charts, electronic data or recordings, laboratory notebooks, or any other format.  The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times.  I agree not to remove such records from the Company?s place of business except as expressly permitted by Company policy which may, from time to time, be revised at the sole election of the Company for the purpose of furthering the Company?s business.

I further agree that my obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in my power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue during and at all times after the end of the Relationship and until the expiration of the last such intellectual property right to expire in any country of the world.  I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such instruments and papers and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the application for, prosecution, issuance, maintenance or transfer of letters patent, copyright, mask work and other registrations related to such Company Inventions.  This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be affected by my subsequent incapacity.\n            (g) Exception to Assignments.  Subject to the requirements of applicable state law, if any, I understand that the Company Inventions will not include, and the provisions of this Agreement requiring assignment of inventions to the Company do not apply to, any invention which qualifies fully for exclusion under the provisions of applicable state law, if any.  In order to assist in the determination of which inventions qualify for such exclusion, I will advise the Company promptly in writing, during and after the term of the Relationship, of all Inventions solely or jointly conceived or developed or reduced to practice by me during the period of the Relationship.\n      5.    Company Property; Returning Company Documents.  I acknowledge and agree that I have no expectation of privacy with respect to the Company?s telecommunications, networking or information processing systems (including, without limitation, files, e-mail messages, and voice messages) and that my activity and any files or messages on or using any of those systems may be monitored or reviewed at any time without notice.

Termination Certification.  In the event of the termination of the Relationship, I agree to sign and deliver the ?Termination Certification? attached hereto as Exhibit B; however, my failure to sign and deliver the Termination Certification shall in no way diminish my continuing obligations under this Agreement.\n      7.    Notice to Third Parties.  I agree that during the periods of time during which I am restricted in taking certain actions by the terms of this Agreement (the ?Restriction Period?), I shall inform any entity or person with whom I may seek to enter into a business relationship (whether as an owner, employee, independent contractor or otherwise) of my contractual obligations under this Agreement.  I also understand and agree that the Company may, with or without prior notice to me and during or after the term of the Relationship, notify third parties of my agreements and obligations under this Agreement.  I further agree that, upon written request by the Company, I will respond to the Company in writing regarding the status of my employment or proposed employment with any party during the Restriction Period.\n      8.    Solicitation of Employees, Consultants and Other Parties.  As described above, I acknowledge and agree that the Company?s Confidential Information includes information relating to the Company?s employees, consultants, customers and others, and that I will not use or disclose such Confidential Information except as authorized by the Company.  I further agree as follows:\n            (a) Employees, Consultants. I agree that during the term of the Relationship, and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of the Relationship for any reason, whether with or without cause, I shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company?s employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the Company, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or consultants of the Company, either for myself or for any other person or entity.\n            (b) Other Parties.  I agree that during the term of the Relationship, I will not negatively influence any of the Company?s clients, licensors, licensees or customers from purchasing Company products or services or solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, licensor, licensee, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.  In addition, I acknowledge that the Company has valuable Trade Secrets (as defined by applicable law from time to time) to which I will have access during the term of the Relationship.  I understand that the Company intends to vigorously pursue its rights under applicable Trade Secrets law if, during a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of the Relationship for any reason, whether with or without cause, I solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, licensor, licensee, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.  Thereafter, the Company intends to vigorously pursue its rights under applicable Trade Secrets law as the circumstances warrant.\n      9.    At-Will Relationship.  I understand and acknowledge that, except as may be otherwise explicitly provided in a separate written agreement between the Company and me, my Relationship with the Company is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law, meaning that either I or the Company may terminate the Relationship at any time for any reason or no reason, without further obligation or liability, other than those provisions of this Agreement that explicitly continue in effect after the termination of the Relationship.\n      10.   Representations and Covenants.\n            (a) Facilitation of Agreement.  I agree to execute promptly, both during and after the end of the Relationship, any proper oath, and to verify any proper document, required to carry out the terms of this Agreement, upon the Company?s written request to do so.\n            (b) No Conflicts.  I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement does not and will not breach any agreement I have entered into, or will enter into, with any third party, including without limitation any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information or materials acquired by me in confidence or in trust prior to or during the Relationship.  I will not disclose to the Company or use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  I will not induce the Company to use any inventions, confidential or non-public proprietary information, or material belonging to any previous client, employer or any other party.  I acknowledge and agree that I have listed on Exhibit?A all agreements (e.g., non-competition agreements, non-solicitation of customers agreements, non-solicitation of employees agreements, confidentiality agreements, inventions agreements, etc.), if any, with a current or former client, employer, or any other person or entity, that may restrict my ability to accept employment with the Company or my ability to recruit or engage customers or service providers on behalf of the Company, or otherwise relate to or restrict my ability to perform my duties for the Company or any obligation I may have to the Company.  I agree not to enter into any written or oral agreement that conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.\n            (c) Voluntary Execution.  I certify and acknowledge that I have carefully read all of the provisions of this Agreement, that I understand and have voluntarily accepted such provisions, and that I will fully and faithfully comply with such provisions.\n      11.   Electronic Delivery.  Nothing herein is intended to imply a right to participate in any of the Company?s equity incentive plans, however, if I do participate in such plan(s), the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to my participation in the Company?s equity incentive plan(s) by electronic means or to request my consent to participate in such plan(s) by electronic means.  I hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree, if applicable, to participate in such plan(s) through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.\n      12.   Miscellaneous.\n            (a) Governing Law.  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement, and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.\n            (b) Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and me relating to its subject matter and merges all prior discussions between us.  No amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties to this Agreement.  The Company shall not be deemed hereby to have waived any rights or remedies it may have in law or equity, nor to have given any authorizations or waived any of its rights under this Agreement, unless, and only to the extent, it does so by a specific writing signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, it being understood that, even if I am an officer of the Company, I will not have authority to give any such authorizations or waivers for the Company under this Agreement without specific approval by the Board of Directors.  Any subsequent change or changes in my duties, obligations, rights or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.\n            (c) Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement will be binding upon my heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives, and my successors and assigns, and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.\n            (d) Notices.  Any notice, demand or request required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient when delivered personally or by overnight courier or sent by email, or 48 hours after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or registered mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the party to be notified at such party?s address as set forth on the signature page, as subsequently modified by written notice, or if no address is specified on the signature page, at the most recent address set forth in the Company?s books and records. \n            (e) Severability.  If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.  The Company and I have attempted to limit my right to use, maintain and disclose the Company?s Confidential Information, and to limit my right to solicit employees and customers only to the extent necessary to protect the Company from unfair competition.  Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section?8 exceeds the maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the parties intend that the court should reform, modify and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time.   \n            (f) Remedies.  I acknowledge and agree that violation of this Agreement by me may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore I agree that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, I agree that a $1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.\n            (g) Advice of Counsel.  I acknowledge THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, I Have HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND I Have read and understood ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.\n            (h) Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. \n[Signature Page Follows]\n      \nThe parties have executed this Agreement on the respective dates set forth below, to be effective as of the Effective Date first above written.\n\nEXHIBIT?B \nTERMINATION CERTIFICATION\n      This is to certify that I do not have in my possession, nor have I failed to return, any devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, flow charts, materials, equipment, other documents or property, or copies or reproductions of any aforementioned items belonging to BenefitMy Inc., a Delaware corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, the ?Company?).\n      I further certify that I have complied with all the terms of the Company?s Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement signed by me, including the reporting of any Inventions (as defined therein), conceived or made by me (solely or jointly with others) covered by that agreement, and I acknowledge my continuing obligations under that agreement.\n      I further agree that, in compliance with the Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, I will preserve as confidential all trade secrets, confidential knowledge, data or other proprietary information relating to products, processes, know-how, designs, formulas, developmental or experimental work, computer programs, data bases, other original works of authorship, customer lists, business plans, financial information or other subject matter pertaining to any business of the Company or any of its employees, clients, consultants or licensees.\n      I further agree that for twelve (12) months from the date of this Certification, I shall not either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company?s employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the Company, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or consultants of the Company, either for myself or for any other person or entity.\n      Further, I agree that I shall not use any Confidential Information of the Company to negatively influence any of the Company?s clients or customers from purchasing Company products or services or to solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.\n      Further, I acknowledge that the Company has valuable Trade Secrets (as defined by applicable law from time to time) to which I have had access.

This notice has important information about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a temporary extension of coverage under the Plan.  This notice explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect your right to get it.  When you become eligible for COBRA, you may also become eligible for other coverage options that may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage.\n\nThe right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).  COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you and other members of your family when group health coverage would otherwise end.  For more information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan\u2019s Summary Plan Description or contact the Plan Administrator.  \n\nYou may have other options available to you when you lose group health coverage.  For example, you may be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace.  By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, you may qualify for lower costs on your monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs.  Additionally, you may qualify for a 30-day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which you are eligible (such as a spouse\u2019s plan), even if that plan generally doesn\u2019t accept late enrollees.  \n\nWhat is COBRA continuation coverage?\n\nCOBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when it would otherwise end because of a life event.  This is also called a \u201cqualifying event.\u201d  Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice.  After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \u201cqualified beneficiary.\u201d  You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event.  Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage.  \n\nIf you\u2019re an employee, you\u2019ll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* Your hours of employment are reduced, or\n* Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct.\n\nIf you\u2019re the spouse of an employee, you\u2019ll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* Your spouse dies;\n* Your spouse\u2019s hours of employment are reduced;\n* Your spouse\u2019s employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;  \n* Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or\n* You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse.\n\nYour dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events:\n\n* The parent-employee dies;\n* The parent-employee\u2019s hours of employment are reduced;\n* The parent-employee\u2019s employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct;\n* The parent-employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both);\n* The parents become divorced or legally separated; or\n* The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a \u201cdependent child.\u201d\n\nWhen is COBRA continuation coverage available?\n\nThe Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred.  The employer must notify the Plan Administrator of the following qualifying events:\n* The end of employment or reduction of hours of employment; \n* Death of the employee; \n* [add if Plan provides retiree health coverage:  Commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer;]; or \n* The employee\u2019s becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both).\n\nFor all other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child\u2019s losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), you must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs.  You must provide this notice to: HR at BenefitMy Inc.. \n\nHow is COBRA continuation coverage provided?\n\nOnce the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries.  Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage.  Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children.  \n\nCOBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage that generally lasts for 18 months due to employment termination or reduction of hours of work. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of coverage, may permit a beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of coverage.\n\nThere are also ways in which this 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended:  \n\nDisability extension of 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage\n\nIf you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by Social Security to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to get up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 29 months.  The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage. \n\nSecond qualifying event extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage\n\nIf your family experiences another qualifying event during the 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if the Plan is properly notified about the second qualifying event.  This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children getting COBRA continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies; becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); gets divorced or legally separated; or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child.  This extension is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred.\n\nAre there other coverage options besides COBRA Continuation Coverage?\n\nYes.  Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse\u2019s plan) through what is called a \u201cspecial enrollment period.\u201d   Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage.   You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov.\n\nIf you have questions\n\nQuestions concerning your Plan or your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the contact or contacts identified below.  For more information about your rights under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), including COBRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional or District Office of the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) in your area or visit www.dol.gov/ebsa.

For more information about the Marketplace, visit www.HealthCare.gov.  \n\nKeep your Plan informed of address changes\n\nTo protect your family\u2019s rights, let the Plan Administrator know about any changes in the addresses of family members.  You should also keep a copy, for your records, of any notices you send to the Plan Administrator.\n\nPlan contact information\n\nPlease contact HR person at BenefitMy Inc. and/or the broker of BenefitMy Inc..

If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.  The Company and I have attempted to limit my right to use, maintain and disclose the Company?s Confidential Information, and to limit my right to solicit employees and customers only to the extent necessary to protect the Company from unfair competition.  Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section?8 exceeds the maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the parties intend that the court should reform, modify and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time.   \n            (f) Remedies.  I acknowledge and agree that violation of this Agreement by me may cause the Company irreparable harm, and therefore I agree that the Company will be entitled to seek extraordinary relief in court, including, but not limited to, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other security (or, where such a bond or security is required, I agree that a $1,000 bond will be adequate), in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have for a breach of this Agreement.\n            (g) Advice of Counsel.  I acknowledge THAT, IN EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, I Have HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL, AND I Have read and understood ALL OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AGAINST ANY PARTY BY REASON OF THE DRAFTING OR PREPARATION HEREOF.\n            (h) Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. \n[Signature Page Follows]\n      \nThe parties have executed this Agreement on the respective dates set forth below, to be effective as of the Effective Date first above written.\n\nEXHIBIT?B \nTERMINATION CERTIFICATION\n      This is to certify that I do not have in my possession, nor have I failed to return, any devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, laboratory notebooks, flow charts, materials, equipment, other documents or property, or copies or reproductions of any aforementioned items belonging to BenefitMy Inc., a Delaware corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively, the ?Company?).\n      I further certify that I have complied with all the terms of the Company?s Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement signed by me, including the reporting of any Inventions (as defined therein), conceived or made by me (solely or jointly with others) covered by that agreement, and I acknowledge my continuing obligations under that agreement.\n      I further agree that, in compliance with the Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, I will preserve as confidential all trade secrets, confidential knowledge, data or other proprietary information relating to products, processes, know-how, designs, formulas, developmental or experimental work, computer programs, data bases, other original works of authorship, customer lists, business plans, financial information or other subject matter pertaining to any business of the Company or any of its employees, clients, consultants or licensees.\n      I further agree that for twelve (12) months from the date of this Certification, I shall not either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company?s employees or consultants to terminate their relationship with the Company, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away employees or consultants of the Company, either for myself or for any other person or entity.\n      Further, I agree that I shall not use any Confidential Information of the Company to negatively influence any of the Company?s clients or customers from purchasing Company products or services or to solicit or influence or attempt to influence any client, customer or other person either directly or indirectly, to direct any purchase of products and/or services to any person, firm, corporation, institution or other entity in competition with the business of the Company.\n      Further, I acknowledge that the Company has valuable Trade Secrets (as defined by applicable law from time to time) to which I have had access.
